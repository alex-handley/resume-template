- project: Multi touch marketing attribution modelling
  role: Lead Data Engineer
  duration: 2017 &mdash; 2018
  description: Wonderbly like the majority of tech startups drives sales through online marketing so making marketing spend performant was an early priority.<br />This was done by tracking each interaction a customer had with us and then with this data building attribution models to surface marketing performance. An example of an attribution model is last click attribution where the last interaction takes all credit for a conversion.<br /><br />The attribution models were live when I joined the project but there was a mixture of software bugs and behaviour not being considered by the models. Once I had resolved the software issues, the next step was to refactor and document the processes to make this part of the data pipeline more accessible for future contributors.<br />Now that attribution was functioning correctly  I paired up with a marketing analyst to find shortcomings of the model, make improvements and finally monitor the changes to see if they were successful.<br /><br />
    The final part of the project involved implementing a new model using the Time Decay technique, with the aim of better understanding the behaviours of repeat purchase customers.

- project: King & Mcgaw (formally EasyArt)
  role: Lead Developer and coach
  duration: 2013 &mdash; 2014

  description: King & Mcgaw is one of the largest online art resellers in Europe, with different regional brands but with mostly the same underlining content. I was brought in to work with the King & Mcgaw engineering team to advise on the best way to re-architect their web infrastructure which consisted of Perl and PHP apps that people were afraid to touch.
    <br />
    Along the way I paired with the whole team to get them up to speed on Ruby and working in Agile Sprints.
    <br />
    The regional sites logic was duplicated across all of the site which made maintenance hard.
    The solution was to create slim Rails apps for each of the websites and then create a SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) to allow the art catalogue to be shared by these apps. We made it super easy to spin up these sites by gemifying the model layer of the app so the consuming application developer could use an ActiveRecord like API to query the catalogue.
    <br />
    Due to the number of items they sold we elected to use ElasticSearch to create a faceted search index which allowed customers to search by facets like primary colours or size.

- project: Serious Fox
  role: Co-founder
  duration: 2009 &mdash; 2015
  description: During my last year at university, I teamed up with a friend and started offering Apple server installation and support. The business grew and after I finished university and we both decided to see how far we could go with the business in 6 months. <br />
We quickly decided to move from hardware to web development and Josh showed me a language called Ruby which was getting some popularity. Over the next 6 years, we grew the company to 5 people doing work for one person outfits wanting to make a quick MVP to companies like Tech City and Tottenham Hotspur who worked with us on longer projects.
