  description: At Wonderbly we track each interaction a customer has with us and then apply different models to the interactions. For example last click attribution where the last interaction takes all credit for a conversion.
    <br />
    The project involved analysing and improving existing models after receiving feedback from marketing analysts about incorrect behaviour they were seeing. The project also involved implementing a new model using the Time Decay technique to show the behaviours of repeat purchase customers.

  description: I organise a meetup for around 30 people to learn how algorithms work. Each session we select an algorithm, watch a short presentation and then start hacking on some challenges. My main aim is making the group approachable to newbies and vets alike.

  description: King & Mcgaw is one of the largest online art resellers in Europe, with different regional brands but with mostly the same underlining content. I was brought in to work with the King & Mcgaw engineering team to advise on the best way to re-architect their web infrastructure which consisted of Perl and PHP apps that people were afraid to touch.
    <br />
    Along the way I paired with the whole team to get them up to speed on Ruby and working in Agile Sprints.
    <br />
    The regional sites logic was duplicated across all of the site which made maintenance hard.
    The solution was to create slim Rails apps for each of the websites and then create a SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) to allow the art catalogue to be shared by these apps. We made it super easy to spin up these sites by gemifying the model layer of the app so the consuming application developer could use an ActiveRecord like API to query the catalogue.
    <br />
    Due to the number of items they sold we elected to use ElasticSearch to create a faceted search index which allowed customers to search by facets like primary colours or size.

  description: During my last year at university I teamed up with a friend and started offering Apple server installation and support. The business grew and after I left university we carried it on fulltime at first from a sofa in our flat.

    We quickly moved from hardware to web and Josh convinced me to work in a language called Ruby. Over the next 6 years we grew the company to 5 people doing work for one person outfits wanting to make a quick MVP for a pitch to companies like Cisco, Tech City and Tottenham Hotspur who worked with us on 6 month long projects.
