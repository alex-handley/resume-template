    - I joined Memrise as the first dedicated data engineer to support forming a data team. Like most data teams in 2018, the first focus was GDPR as it was coming into force within four months. My approach to this was to educate the company on what this meant for how they handled and used data. Once I had the stakeholders onboard, I began to reshape how data was consumed, stored and used within the company.

    - The data team grew quickly which resulted in a ratio of one data engineer to seven data scientists/analysts. With this ratio, I made it a priority to make it easy and safe for the team to commit code to the Airflow repository. This was accomplished by enforcing using pull requests with integrated code linting which required a review. To help reduce the number of bugs introduced I deployed a staging server so features could be tested on an environment similar to production before going live.<br />
    Once the development process was working I made it easy to set up the Airflow application locally and added a framework to create automated tests end to end tests with the CI server.
