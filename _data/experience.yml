  duration: October, 2016 &mdash; Present
  summary: "
    My role as a data engineer at Wonderbly cuts across most aspects of data engineering as we are a fairly small team. I maintain both the Amazon Redshift clusters and the tooling for the rest of the team so they can run run remote tasks using Amazon ECS/Docker. Because we are a small team we want to make it easy for anyone to contribute code so I am in the process of creating an SQL test runner so our continuous integration server can report back in Pull Requests if there is broken functionality due to changes made. Our current architecture is a twice a day ETL this allows us to deliver reporting to the whole business on how the previous day from an marketing channel/ad perspective to how much we spent producing books. Our second ETL runs mid morning and fills in missing data due to timezone or Google Analytics data still processing.
    <br />
      Day to day I work on feature development which would normally involve analysing a problem and presenting back to the team using data notebooks highlighting the problem with a possible solution. After the analysis is complete I would create a working specification and implement a solution.
      Sown examples of this are the multi touch attribution models we do at Wonderbly, I have analysed existing models after receiving feedback from marketing analysts and also implementing time decay models to show the behaviours of repeat purchase customers.
      Another large analysis piece I have lead is validating the finance figures our system produces. This was followed by remodelling how some components work and adding new components such as showing profit and loss for the unit addons we sell and improving the accuracy of our shipping/production cost reporting. This work has allowed me to now expose key figures like net revenue and gross profit at an Ad level which means our marketing team can now analysis the profitability of ads at unit level.
    <br />
    Our team has had a Data scientist join and this has lead to us beginning to do more analysis using Machine Learning. I have been working with them to create a framework for managing experiments, once it is finished we will be able to manage datasets so we have a reproducible way to run experiments have a reproducible way to run experiments have a reproducible way to run experiments
