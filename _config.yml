  <p>
    My titles have varied from Full-stack developer to most recently as a data engineer. But at the heart of it, I am an engineer who loves solving problems which have a human element. That could be a customer who is struggling to buy our products due to a bug or a CRM team who would love to segment customers better using the business's customer data.
